		<h1>Matt Beatty</h1>
		<p>Hey there! I am a senior at Harvard University, studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm really excited about distributed systems, security, and social networks.</p>
		<p class="centered"><a href="mailto:beattymg@gmail.com;">Email</a> / <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/beattymg">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://github.com/beattymg">Github</a></p>

		<h3 style="color:#2e7ad1">Harvard</h3>
		<p>I've had the privilege to attend a great university. I've been involved with research since I arrived on campus freshman year in 2014. Right now I am researching influence models in social networks under Professor <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~yaron/">Yaron Singer</a>. Before that, I was worked with the Molecular Systems Lab at the <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/">Wyss Institute</a> on DNA computing.</p>
		<p>A few courses I've taken that are relevant/great:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CS182: Artificial Intelligence</li>
			<li>CS124: Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
			<li>CS136: Economics and Computation</li>
			<li>CS134: Networks </li>
			<li>CS152: Programming Languages </li>
			<li>CS121: Theory of Computation </li>
			<li>AM107: Applied Graph Theory and Combinatorics </li>
			<li>STAT104: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		<p>I've had the great fortune to work with/in some amazing companies, ranging from a Fortune 500 business to a three-person company.</p>
		<ul>

			<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrains</a> - I built user interface features for phones and tablets for <a href="https://www.datalore.io">DataLore</a>, an upcoming data science product.</li>
			<li><a href="https://yin.hms.harvard.edu/">Molecular Systems Lab</a> - I created editing tools for <a href="https://yin.hms.harvard.edu/bricks/try/">NanoBricks</a>, an online platform for researcher to design DNA structures.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.beek.co/">Beek</a> - I created an administrative dashboard for the companies 100's of clients to use.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.yonix.com/">Yonix</a> - I designed the login and account recovery system for the companies main web portal.</li>

		</ul>


		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<p>I am a big fan of personal projects. Since 2009, I've made 8 web apps. I built them to scratch my own itch. Some got accidentally popular because other people found them useful too.</p>
		<p>I will admit that some of these apps are old, don't work well (by today's standard), or might not be functional at all (due to API changes). Treat it more like an archive than a list of you should use today.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://coursica.io">Coursica</a> lets you browse Harvard's course catalog and plan your classes. Over 40,000 courses have been viewed on the app. There are native <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coursica/id1025621851?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coursica.coursica">Android</a>, and Meteor-based <a href="https://coursica.io">web</a> versions.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.github.com/beattymg/btcbot">BTCBot</a> is an automated Bitcoin trading bot. It served me well and has now been retired. (Sensitive source code was removed.)</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.github.com/beattymg/react-native-running-app">Run Tracker</a> lets you track your GPS location while you move on your phone. I wanted to experiment with React-Native and built this app.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/beattymg/Deep-Crimson">Deep Crimson</a> is an AI chessplayer robot built for CS182. It achieved an Elo rating over 1600, meaning it play competitively in tournaments. </li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/beattymg/microsoft-mingle">Microsoft Meet</a> fosters connections between Microsoft employees offering a chance to connect with others. Built for the One Microsoft Hackathon.</li>
			<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jdateconverter&hl=en">Julian Date Converter</a> is an Android app for converting between Gregorian datetimes and Julian datetimes. I put it on the app store back in 2012, and it has been downloaded by 1000s.</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
		<p>I love scuba diving, hiking, and the Boston Red Sox.</p>
